# CCDBusTransceiver
Development board for interfacing Chrysler's legacy CCD-bus (no CDP68HC68S1 chip needed).

To be used with [CCDLibrary](https://github.com/laszlodaniel/CCDLibrary).

The Chrysler CCD/SCI Scanner V1.4X [Firmware](https://github.com/laszlodaniel/ChryslerCCDSCIScanner/tree/master/Arduino/ChryslerCCDSCIScanner) and [GUI](https://github.com/laszlodaniel/ChryslerCCDSCIScanner/raw/master/GUI/ChryslerCCDSCIScanner/bin/Debug/ChryslerCCDSCIScanner_V14X_GUI.zip) works with this hardware. There are obvious limitations of course and there may be connections issues but worth a try.
